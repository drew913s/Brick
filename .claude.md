This is the Brick Architecture project. All code must follow the brick specification:

## Required Constraints
- Maximum 50 lines per file (excluding blank lines and comments)
- Clear docstring with inputs/outputs/errors
- Explicit error handling (return errors in output structure)
- No eval/exec/shell=True/SQL concatenation
- Single responsibility per brick
- Include tests in the same file or companion test file

## Before Coding
1. Show me the brick breakdown for the task
2. Show me how bricks compose together
3. Ask for approval before generating code

## Verification Checklist
For each brick you generate:
- ✓ Under 50 lines?
- ✓ Docstring present with clear contract?
- ✓ Error handling included?
- ✓ Tests included?
- ✓ No banned patterns?
- ✓ Single responsibility?

Confirm you understand the brick architecture specification before proceeding with any coding tasks.
